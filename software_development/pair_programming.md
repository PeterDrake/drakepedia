# Pair Programming
## Overview
*Pair programming* is a software development process wherein two programmers work together at one computer. One programmer takes the role of the *driver*, thinking about the fine details, actually typing and editing code, and explaining what they are doing. The other programmer is the *navigator*, thinking about the big picture, offering advice and suggestions, asking questions, and consulting documentation. The members of the pair should be in constant conversation so that they can switch roles at any moment.

## Questions
1. :star: What are the two roles in pair programming?
1. :star::star: What are the advantages of pair programming?
1. :star::star: Is pair programming really used in industry or is it just an educational technique?
1. :star::star: If the navigator has access to a second computer, what might they reasonably use it for?
1. :star::star: If one member of the pair is significantly more experienced, which one should drive?
1. :star::star: How often should the members of the pair switch roles?
## Answers
1. Driver and navigator. Some sources call the navigator the observer.
1. Increased programmer satisfaction, fewer errors, and spread of knowledge between programmers. Two programmers working in a pair can also complete a task faster than one working alone (although probably not twice as fast).
1. It is used by many companies, though certainly not all.
1. Looking up documentation, e.g., [the Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
1. The less-experienced member should drive first; one "expert" furiously typing in code using fancy techniques is likely to leave the other member feeling discouraged and disengaged. That said, the two members of the pair should switch roles regularly.
1. Probably at least once an hour.
