# eXtreme Programming
## Overview
Extreme Programming (XP) is a process for software development. Like other agile methods, it focuses on tight feedback loops, both between the developers and the code and and between the developers and the customer. This is intended to keep everyone's expectations accurate and avoid unpleasant surprises.
## Development Process
### Initial Setup
A couple of things have to happen before the customer and the developers have their first meeting.
#### User Stories
The customer has to write a set of *user stories*. (This is currently done in a shared Google Doc.) Each story describes some desired capability of the software. For example:

| Save File |
|-|
|The user can save the state of the file they are editing.|

Stories should be relatively small and testable *by the customer*. They should avoid any technical details about *how* a feature will be implemented.

Stories will be modified, added, and discarded as the project proceeds. Nothing is etched in stone.
#### Setting Up a GitHub Repository
**One developer** should [create a new GitHub repository](setting_up_githib.md). The others should then clone it to their local machines.
### Iteration
Development proceeds in a series of iterations (known in some other agile methods as sprints). For the main Software Development project, each iteration lasts two weeks.
#### Customer Meeting
#### Planning
#### Coding
#### Delivery
