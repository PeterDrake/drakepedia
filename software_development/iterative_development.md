# Iterative Development
## Overview
If you are asked to write a *very* simple program, perhaps a few lines long, there is a chance that you will be able to formulate a plan in your head and then write correct code on the first try. For nontrivial programs, this is, in practice, *impossible*. It is unreasonable to imagine that you will perfectly understand the problem specification and make no syntax or logic errors. Beyond that, the process of developing software inevitably reveals unforeseen complications.

The accepted solution to this conundrum (across many fields of design, not just software development) is the process of *iterative development*.

Start by writing down a list of tasks that you will need to accomplish to solve the problem. Don't worry about making this list perfect; you'll be able to change it later.
 
Now write a ridiculously simple program and get it to work. Even getting the classic "Hello, world!" program to run can help you resolve issues with installing and using your editor, compiler, debugger, libraries, and other tools.

Once you have something running, make a series of passes (iterations) through the following steps:

1. Plan out what improvement you want to make next. You may find an appropriate task on your list, or you may find that one of those tasks must be divided into smaller tasks. Aim for the smallest possible improvement that you could make that would take you from your currently running program to a slightly better running program.
1. Make the change. Avoid the dangerous temptation to change more than one thing. If you see other things that could be improved, add them to your task list for future iterations.
1. Evaluate your change. Did it work? How do you know? If this improvement is complete, go back to step 1 and make the next one. Otherwise, go back to step 2 and correct or finish this change.

It is important to make as many short iterations as possible. Think of software development like diving for treasure or bringing the groceries in from the car: trying to do everything in one trip is a recipe for disaster.
