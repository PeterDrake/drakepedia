# Drakepedia
This repository holds topic summaries and questions for [Peter Drake](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/drake/)'s
computer science courses. If you're looking for the [musician's fansite](http://drakepedia.com/) or the
[univerity's wiki](https://drakeapedia.library.drake.edu/wiki/Main_Page), you've come to the wrong place.

I have three purposes in creating this repository:
1. To keep my own notes and useful links organized.
1. To provide a place where I can direct students' frequently-asked questions.
1. To provide a bank of questions and answers, which both serves as a study guide and makes exam creation easier. Answers are
provided, but there should be so many questions that memorizing all of the answers is untenable.

I list additional online and print resources where applicable, trying to list the most valuable ones first. In general, print
resources go into more depth or provide a more gentle explanation.

Questions are rated according to their difficulty:
- :star: By the end of the course in question, you should be able to answer these questions immediately off the top of your
head. They often involve terminology or basic concepts.
- :star::star: These questions may take a bit of thought or close reading. They test whether you have a firm grasp on the
concept at hand.
- :star::star::star: These challenging questions require application or analysis. They may require some research.
