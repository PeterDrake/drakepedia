**NOTE: As we shift from Java to Python, this site is gradually being supplanted by [Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/README.md), created with Alain KÃ¤gi. The Java content here is no longer being maintained. My students will have use for pages in the [administrivia](administrivia) section.**

# Drakepedia
This repository holds topic summaries and questions for [Peter Drake](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/drake/)'s
computer science courses.

I have three purposes in creating this repository:
1. To keep my own notes and useful links organized.
1. To provide a place where I can direct students' frequently-asked questions.
1. To provide a bank of questions and answers, which both serves as a study guide and makes exam creation easier. Answers are
provided, but there should be so many questions that memorizing all of the answers is infeasible.

I list additional online and print resources where applicable, trying to list the most valuable ones first. In general, print
resources go into more depth or provide a more gentle explanation.

Questions are rated according to their difficulty:
- :star: By the end of the course in question, you should be able to answer these questions immediately off the top of your
head. They often involve terminology or basic concepts.
- :star::star: These questions may take a bit of thought, close reading, experimentation, or research.
- :star::star::star: These questions require even more.

The table below shows which topics I expect people to learn in which courses. (CS1 is taught in C, but for these topics C and Java are very similar.) Links are to existing pages in the Drakepedia.
