# Drakepedia
This repository holds topic summaries and questions for [Peter Drake](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/drake/)'s computer science courses. If you're looking for the [musician's fansite](http://drakepedia.com/) or the [univerity's wiki](https://drakeapedia.library.drake.edu/wiki/Main_Page), you've come to the wrong place.

I have three purposes in creating this repository:
1. To keep my own notes and useful links organized.
1. To provide a place where I can direct students' frequently-asked questions.
1. To provide a bank of questions and answers, which both serves as study guide and makes exam creation easier. Answers are provided, but there should be so many questions that memorizing all of the answers is untenable.
