## Questions
1. :star::star: Is a tree with more than one node ever both a max heap and a binary search tree? If so, give an example. If not, explain why not.
1. :star::star: What approach would you use to find the 10 smallest numbers in an unsorted array of 1,000,000,000 numbers?
## Answers
1. Yes. For example, a tree with 2 at the root and 1 as its left child meets both definitions.
1. Put all of the numbers into a min priority queue and repeatedly (10 times) remove the minimum.
