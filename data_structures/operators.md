# Operators
## Overview
*Operators* are used to combine expressions (such as [literals](data_structures/primitive_types.md#Literals)) into larger expressions. For example, in `2 + 3`, the `+` operator combines the two operands `2` and `3` into a larger expression with the value 5.

*Binary operators*, like `+`, are *infix*, meaning that they appear between their two operands. *Unary operators*, like `-` when it is used for negation rather than subtraction, are *prefix* if they appear before the operand and *postfix* if they appear afterward. There is one *ternary operator*, `?:`, which takes three arguments, one before the `?`, one between the `?` and `:`, and one after the `:`.

The operators are summarized in the table below. See the additional resources for more information.
