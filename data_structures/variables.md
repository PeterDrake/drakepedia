1. :star: If `alive` is a boolean variable, what shorter expression is equivalent to `alive == true`?
## Answers
1. `alive`. If `alive == true`, `alive` is true; if not, `alive` is false. In other words, `alive` and `alive == true` always have exactly the same value. The shorter version is always preferable as it is clearer, is more concise, and avoids the risk of accidentally typing `alive = true` (which is an assignment, not a comparison).
