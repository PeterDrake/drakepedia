# Variables
## Questions
1. :star: If `alive` is a boolean variable, how can `alive == true` be replaced with a shorter expression?
## Answers
1. If `alive == true`, `alive` is true; if not, `alive` is false. In other words, `alive` and `alive == true` always have exactly the same value. The shorter version is always preferable as it is clearer, is more concise, and avoids the risk of accidentally typing `alive = true` (which is an assignment, not a comparison).
