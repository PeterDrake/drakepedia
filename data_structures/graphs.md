# Graphs
## Terminology
A *graph* consists of a set of *vertices* and a set of *edges*. Each edge connects two vertices.

In the graph below, there are eight vertices, numbered 0 through 7. There is an edge connecting vertices 0 and 1, but no edge connecting 1 and 2.

![Edges are 0-1, 0-4, 1-4, 1-5, 2-5, 2-6, 3-7, 4-5, 5-6, and 6-7](graph.svg)

The *neighbors* of a vertex are the vertices directly connected to it by edges. In the graph above, 4's neighbors are 0, 1, and 5.
