# Arrays
## Declaring and Initializing Arrays
An array holds several elements of the same type. It is declared by adding `[]` after the element type:
```java
int[] arr;
```
To initialize an array, you have to use the keyword `new` and specify how many elements the array contains:
```java
arr = new int[4];
```
While the distinction is irrelevant in *most* situations, it's best to think of the array variable as holding a *reference to* the array:
