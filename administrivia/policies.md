# Policies

## Academic Integrity

Read the College's Statement on Academic Integrity (the first two pages of the [Policies and Procedures section](https://www.lclark.edu/live/files/6190-cas-catalogpolicies-and-procedurespdf) of the Handbook) and sections VIII (Outcomes) and XVI (College Honor Board Hearing Procedures) of the [Student Code of Conduct](http://college.lclark.edu/live/files/12481-code-of-conduct-2012pdf). Yes, it's boring, but it's only a few pages.

You are encouraged to study and discuss topics together. For most assignments you are expected to do the actual coding, math, or writing on your own; for others (which will be clearly identified) you will work as part of a team. When in doubt, mention any people or other sources who helped you.

Remember that *the point of assignments is to help you learn*. This practice and the feedback you receive are vital for you to learn to solve problems in and communicate about the subject. The assignments are not there to punish you, judge you, enforce a hierarchy, or supply the instructor with an additional copy of the answers. Turning in plagiarized work is a waste of everyone's time.

## Assignments

### Handing In Assignments

Hand in assignments through Canvas. If you have trouble with the handin system, talk to me or a teaching assistant as soon as possible to get things straightened out.

### Late Policy

I have several goals in setting a late policy:

* Encourage you to do the work, because practice is where the learning really happens. Earlier assignments prepare you for later ones.
* Help you manage your time and prevent you from getting catastrophically behind.
* Minimize the amount of stress you experience when you do run up against a deadline. I understand that illnesses, athletic events, technical difficulties, and so on sometimes lead to handing in things late.
* Be able to grade everyone's submission to a given assignment at the same time, for efficiency and fairness. 
* Avoid having to waste my time looking at handin dates, listening to requests for extensions, etc.
* Have a reasonable point after which I can discuss the assignment in class without giving away the answer to people who haven't done it yet.

Each assignment therefore has a due date (when you should turn it in) and a **_one-week grace period_**. Outside of *extreme* circumstances, you can't turn things in after the grace period.

Some time (hopefully a couple of days) after the due date, I (or a teaching assistant) will grade the assignment. If you still have time before the grace period, you may hand in a revised version. After the grace period ends, we will grade again.

| Your Excuse for Missing the Grace Period Deadline | What I'll Say |
| --- | --- |
| I was sick for a couple of days. | Sorry, but it's already a week late. |
| My laptop died. | Sorry, but it's already a week late. |
| I had to participate in an athletic event or concert. | Sorry, but it's already a week late. |
| I had to drive my roommate to the hospital. | Sorry, but it's already a week late. |
| My cat died. | I'm very sorry, but it's already a week late. |
| I have special accommodations from Student Support Services. | If the one-week grace period is not sufficient, come talk to me *before* the due date. |
| I was attacked by a llama and I've been in the hospital for a week. | Come talk to me. |
| I was attacked by two llamas and I've been in the hospital for two months. | You should probably withdraw for the semester. |

Do not misinterpret the grace period as the "real" deadline. The deadline is the deadline; the grace period is for emergencies.

**_The last day of regular class (*not* the final exam period) at 11:59 PM (my clock, not yours) is an absolute final deadline after which no assignments will be accepted._**


### Programming Assignments

A program should:
- Compile and run.
- Use exactly the names specified for classes, methods, etc. This both makes my grading easier and is good practice for the inevitable day when you’re working on a large project with many other programmers.
- Behave as specified (e.g., pass all tests).
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Have an interface devoid of spelling and grammatical errors and graphical glitches.
- Clearly present the information the user needs to make decisions and allow the user to easily communicate those decisions back to the program. While it can be very useful during debugging to print some additional information (e.g., about the state of data structures), the final version of a program should not do this.
- Have elegant, [clear](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11style/), well-commented code. Any commented-out code should be removed.
- Behave reasonably even in situations not explicitly tested.

Except where specified, you do not need to do error-checking in programs. For example, if you ask the user to type an integer, you may assume that they will do so, and are not responsible for what happens if they type “fnord” instead.

### Writing Assignments

In general, a paper should:
- Use complete sentences and be devoid of spelling, grammatical, and typographical errors.
- Be well-organized. Similar thoughts should be grouped together. The document should have a purpose; every element should support this purpose.
- Provide evidence for claims. In a research paper, this evidence should include proper citations. Just about any citation format is acceptable, as long as it is consistent; a good choice for computer science is [IEEE style](http://www.ijssst.info/info/IEEE-Citation-StyleGuide.pdf). Tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) can make citing sources vastly less tedious.
- Have something important to say. The very best papers change the reader's thinking about the topic.
- Omit needless words. Language should communicate rather than getting in the way.
- Be single-spaced. Other instructors' preferences may vary, but I believe double-spacing is a relic of the days when feedback was written on paper.

### Mathematical Assignments

Mathematical assignments (both exercises and proofs) are very similar to writing assignments. Acceptable formats include Word (.docx) and PDF; ask in advance if you want to use something more exotic. You must learn to use LaTeX or the equation editor in your word processor.

A mathematical paper should:

- Be correct.
- Be clearly explained, using appropriate notation, prose, and diagrams.
- Address special and boundary cases.

## Disabilities
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation to [Student Support Services](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/student_support_services/). After you have submitted documentation and filled out paperwork for the current semester requesting accommodations, staff in that office will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible.

## Sexual Misconduct

Our school is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and our school policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Sexual misconduct — including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking — is also prohibited at our school.

Our school encourages anyone experiencing sexual misconduct to talk to someone about what happened, so they can get the support they need and our school can respond appropriately.

If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, want more information about filing a report, or have questions about school policies and procedures, please contact our [Title IX Coordinator](https://www.lclark.edu/about/title_ix_compliance/).
Our school is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible.

As a teacher, I am also required by our school to report incidents of sexual misconduct and thus cannot guarantee confidentiality. I must provide our Title IX coordinator with relevant details such as the names of those involved in the incident.
