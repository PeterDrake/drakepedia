# Policies

## COVID-19

* Read [LC's Health and Safety Expectations for All Community Members](https://www.lclark.edu/news/2020-plans/health-and-safety/). TLDR: masks, social distancing, constant handwashing. The danger is real and everyone's actions matter. Behave like you're on an infected cruise ship.
* I will take attendance, both to see if anyone is falling through the cracks and for contact tracing. It does not directly count as part of your grade, although of course students with better attendance tend to do better. **Do not come to a physical class if you are sick or self-isolating.**
* When communicating online:
  * Unless you are talking (or have been instructed otherwise), mute your microphone.
  * If it is reasonable to do so, have your video on. I realize that people may be unable to do this at various times, but if you are comfortable sharing video, it makes it easier for us to feel like a class of scholars learning together rather than a bunch of individuals watching a video independently. Seeing people's faces can also clarify meaning (Are you angry? Are you joking?) and help you make friends.
  * Remember that the text chat window is available.
  * Be present and attentive. I do a lot of "active learning" and small group work; having the class "playing" on your phone while you do something else isn't going to work.
  * Have paper and pencil with you while you are "in class". This lets you take notes without using up precious screen space. If you need to communicate with me, a TA, or other students in diagram form, you can draw on paper and hold it up to the camera.
* I'm here for you! The best way to make sure I see a message is to send me email.

## Academic Integrity

Read the College's Statement on Academic Integrity (the first two pages of the [Policies and Procedures section](https://www.lclark.edu/live/files/6190-cas-catalogpolicies-and-procedurespdf) of the Handbook) and sections VIII (Outcomes) and XVI (College Honor Board Hearing Procedures) of the [Student Code of Conduct](http://college.lclark.edu/live/files/12481-code-of-conduct-2012pdf). Yes, it's boring, but it's only a few pages, and it could save you from throwing away your college career.

You are encouraged to study and discuss topics together. For certain specified assignments, you will work in teams. Of course, you may not work together during exams.

Representing someone else's work as if it were your own is a heinous, career-threatening act. It is dishonest, it robs someone else of their work, and it defeats the purpose of the assignments.

Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated. **_If you plagiarize or otherwise cheat, you will be brought before the College Honor Board._** It's that big a deal. If you're worried or confused, ask before you do something you might regret.

An unskilled computer programmer is just as dangerous as an unskilled bridge designer. [Innocent people have been killed by buggy programs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) If you can't honestly earn good grades in computer science, do something less dangerous for a living.

## Assignments

### Handing In Assignments

Hand in assignments through Canvas. If you have trouble with the handin system, talk to me or a teaching assistant as soon as possible to get things straightened out.

### Programming Assignments

A program should:
- Compile and run.
- Use exactly the names specified for classes, methods, etc. This both makes my grading easier and is good practice for the inevitable day when you’re working on a large project with many other programmers.
- Behave as specified (e.g., pass all tests).
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Have an interface devoid of spelling and grammatical errors and graphical glitches.
- Clearly present the information the user needs to make decisions and allow the user to easily communicate those decisions back to the program. While it can be very useful during debugging to print some additional information (e.g., about the state of data structures), the final version of a program should not do this.
- Have elegant, [clear](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11style/), well-commented code. Any commented-out code should be removed.
- Behave reasonably even in situations not explicitly tested.

Except where specified, you do not need to do error-checking in programs. For example, if you ask the user to type an integer, you may assume that they will do so, and are not responsible for what happens if they type “fnord” instead.

### Writing Assignments

In general, a paper should:
- Use complete sentences and be devoid of spelling, grammatical, and typographical errors.
- Be well-organized. Similar thoughts should be grouped together. The document should have a purpose; every element should support this purpose.
- Provide evidence for claims. In a research paper, this evidence should include proper citations. Just about any citation format is acceptable, as long as it is consistent; a good choice for computer science is [IEEE style](http://www.ijssst.info/info/IEEE-Citation-StyleGuide.pdf). Tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) can make citing sources vastly less tedious.
- Have something important to say. The very best papers change the reader's thinking about the topic.
- Omit needless words. Language should communicate rather than getting in the way.
- Be single-spaced. Other instructors' preferences may vary, but I believe double-spacing is a relic of the days when feedback was written on paper.

### Mathematical Assignments

Mathematical assignments (both exercises and proofs) are very similar to writing assignments. Acceptable formats include Word (.docx) and PDF; ask in advance if you want to use something more exotic. You must learn to use LaTeX or the equation editor in your word processor.

A mathematical paper should:

- Be correct.
- Be clearly explained, using appropriate notation, prose, and diagrams.
- Address special and boundary cases.

## Disabilities
If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation to [Student Support Services](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/student_support_services/). After you have submitted documentation and filled out paperwork for the current semester requesting accommodations, staff in that office will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible.

## Sexual Misconduct

Our school is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and our school policy prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Sexual misconduct — including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking — is also prohibited at our school.

Our school encourages anyone experiencing sexual misconduct to talk to someone about what happened, so they can get the support they need and our school can respond appropriately.

If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, want more information about filing a report, or have questions about school policies and procedures, please contact our [Title IX Coordinator](https://www.lclark.edu/about/title_ix_compliance/).
Our school is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible.

As a teacher, I am also required by our school to report incidents of sexual misconduct and thus cannot guarantee confidentiality. I must provide our Title IX coordinator with relevant details such as the names of those involved in the incident.
