If you are a member of the ACM ($19/year for students), you have digital access to the entire catalogs of O'Reilly and several other publishers. This is not obvious, but here's how to find them:

1. Go to learning.oreilly.com
1. Type your acm email address (e.g., meriwether.lewis1@acm.org) into the upper box
1. Hit tab and the lower box will disappear
1. Click on the big red "Sign In with Single Sign On" bar
1. Enter your ACM username (e.g., meriwether.lewis1) and your ACM password.
