# Textbooks

Joining the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/membership/join) is [currently free](https://services.acm.org/public/qj/freeqj3/fqj_control.cfm?promo=FALL2020) for students.

For an additional $35/year, you can get digital access to the entire catalogs of O'Reilly and several other publishers. Since this is less than the price of a single textbook, it's a good deal. You'll have to email acmhelp@acm.org to set this up.

Once you've done so:

1. Go to https://go.oreilly.com/acm
1. Enter your ACM username (e.g., meriwether.lewis1) and your ACM password.
