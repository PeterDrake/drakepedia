# Letters of Recommendation

Students often ask me for letters of recommendation. I'm happy to provide them, with a few caveats:

- Some lead time is necessary. If you need it in less than a week, I might not be able to help.
- You have to fill out a [release form](https://college.lclark.edu/live/files/16619-release-of-educational-information-for) so that I can talk about your academic record.
- It also helps if you grant me access to your records through WebAdvisor.
- To help me write a better letter, remind me of interesting or impressive things you've done in or out of class. My memory is terrible. Also, you know how many professors you'll have classes from in your entire time at LC? That's how many students I have in each class.
- If you sat in the back of my class two years ago, never said anything, and got a C, I may still be able to write you a letter, but it won't be very helpful to your case. You might be better getting a reference from someone with whom you had a more positive interaction.
