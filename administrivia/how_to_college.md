# How to College

## Why are you here?

A good life is one in which you enjoy yourself and make the world a better place. Your time at Lewis & Clark is meant to prepare you for such a life. Learning is intrinsically pleasurable and puts you in a better position to participate in and help build the world to come. While you have other important things to do while you're here (social activities, a job, volunteering, etc.), you are in courses to learn.

You are not here to prove that you already know everything. **_Ask questions._** The point is not to test you but to expand your skills and understanding. It is crucial to have a [growth mindset](https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/): to realize that abilities (math, writing, etc.) are not fixed and innate but can be improved through effort and practice.

## You are not alone

Instructors strive to give you assignments that are neither too easy or too hard, but require you to stretch. While your final essay, program, etc. must be your own work (or sometimes that of a small team), you are not expected to sit alone in a room and derive everything from first principles. Every hero needs friends, allies, and mentors. Don't hold yourself to an impossible standard.

When something isn't clear or you don't know how to proceed, ask for help. Ask questions in class, in lab or office hours, and on course forums. (Don't imagine that you're the only one confused.) Your instructors, teaching assistants, and fellow students are here for exactly this reason. The ability to answer your questions as they arise the whole point of college; without it, you might as well have stayed home, read a book, and saved a great deal of money.

You can get a free, individual [SAAB tutor](https://aslclark.org/saab-tutoring/) (or, if you're doing well, get paid to be one). The [Writing Center](http://college.lclark.edu/academics/support/writing_center/) and [Symbolic and Quantitative Resource Center (SQRC)](https://college.lclark.edu/departments/mathematical_sciences/sqrc/) are also valuable resources.

You will face challenges, perhaps very serious ones, outside of your courses. There are [resources to help you](https://college.lclark.edu/offices/health_promotion_and_wellness/) with any other issues that may come up, including [physical](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/health_service/) and [mental health](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/counseling_service/). Don't let a nagging problem get out of control. You are not the first one to have been in this boat and you are not alone.

## Prioritize

You have many obligations and opportunities. Invest your limited time wisely.

Keep a calendar so deadlines don't sneak up on you. Assignments take longer than you think. **_Start early_**. If you get done quickly, great. If not, starting early saved you from a panicked all-nighter.

Taking care of yourself is one of your priorities, but think about this in both the short and long terms. Sometimes you really do need to spend two hours watching cat videos, but more often you need to spend them doing an assignment. Remember, your instructor gave you that assignment to help you gain skill and understanding, which will help you in the future.

When time inevitably gets really tight, you may have to resort to [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage). Divide your concerns into things those that are beyond your control, those where your effort will make a difference, and those that will be fine [without your intervention](https://xkcd.com/386/). If you've got three classes where you're getting an easy A+, a C, and a hopeless F, spend your efforts on the C class. If it's not too late, drop the F class. Once the crisis passes, talk with your advisor about what you might do to prevent the next one.

## Plan, change, evaluate

Quality work can't be done in one pass. It requires repeatedly planning what to do next, making some change, and evaluating the result. This is a universal truth that applies to every nontrivial thing you might want to create, including computer programs, mathematical proofs, essays, musical compositions, films, games, speeches, scientific hypotheses, and essays about universal truths.

**_The more passes you make through the plan-change-evaluate cycle, the better your final product._**

Start early and make each pass short. Try to make just one small change each time. Short iterations have several advantages. First, if an evaluation shows that things just got much worse, you know that your last change was probably a bad one. (This information makes debugging vastly easier.) Second, you’ll have something complete at the end of each iteration. When a deadline hits, either in school or later in life, you’d much rather have a working program that’s missing a few features than a "complete" program that "almost" compiles. Third, if each iteration is short, you won’t have to throw away a huge amount of work because it turns out not to be an improvement — or worse, keep it anyway because you worked so hard on it.

For some work (like programming), there is yet another way to do many iterations: automation. Tools like IntelliJ IDEA and JUnit can take care of a lot of mindless, repetitive work for you. This is the wonderful thing about computer science: **_if it’s tedious, you’re doing it wrong_**.
